# Aquaint

Aquaint is a web application for people who want to socialize for whatever reason their heart desires. It is a friend matching application that lets users see potential friends around the area and match with the ones who seem the most compatible.

Why I wanted to build this app:
I wanted to build this project becuase I felt that my social skills were at an all time low and it felt harder in general to make connections due to the pandemic. The idea why, is that if dating could have a wider range due to applications being built why can't friendships as well. On the technical side, this project allowed me to bring together the foundations I learned from both front-end and backend development to create a functional full stack  web application.

To check it out for yourself here is the live version:

Technologies Used: This was built using the framework library React alongside babel JSX loader, webpack (for compiling), multer(for fileuploads), Node.js and Express (for routing), PostgresQL, HTML/CSS, BootStrap for modern responsive design, Google API alongside geolocation for map visualization, and dotenv for environment variables/secrets.

Finished Features: User Can Create Profile, Upload a Profile Pic, Enable and pinpoint location, match with other users, reject another user, view matchlist
and individual profiles, update info for profile, and delete matches off friendslist.

Strech Features: I would like to include sms messaging using Twilio for event planning, and possibly some kind of video chat feature using Socket.IO
