# Aquaint

Aquaint is a web application for people who want to socialize for whatever reason their heart desires. It is a friend matching application that lets users see potential friends around the area and match with the ones who seem the most compatible.

### Why I wanted to build this app:
I wanted to build this project becuase I felt that my social skills were at an all time low and it felt harder in general to make connections due to the pandemic. The idea why, is that if dating could have a wider range due to applications being built why can't friendships as well. On the technical side, this project allowed me to bring together the foundations I learned from both front-end and backend development to create a functional full stack  web application.

## Live Version:

-babel JSX loader
